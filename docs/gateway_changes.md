# Gateway Changes Documentation

## Problem
The URL shortening endpoint was returning a gRPC connection error: `{"code":1, "message":"grpc: the client connection is closing", "details":[]}`. This was happening because the gRPC gateway context was being canceled immediately after setup.

## Solution
The issue was fixed by modifying the `setupGateway()` function in `server/gateway.go`. Here are the key changes:

1. **Context Management**
   - Removed the `defer cancel()` call that was causing premature context cancellation
   - Changed the context handling to keep it alive for the duration of the server's lifetime
   - The context is now stored in a variable that can be used later if needed

2. **Before (Problematic Code)**:
```go
func setupGateway() (http.Handler, error) {
    ctx := context.Background()
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
    defer cancel()  // This was causing the issue
    // ... rest of the code
}
```

3. **After (Fixed Code)**:
```go
func setupGateway() (http.Handler, error) {
    ctx := context.Background()
    ctx, _ = context.WithCancel(ctx)  // Context remains alive
    // ... rest of the code
}
```

## Impact
- The gRPC gateway now maintains a stable connection to the gRPC server
- URL shortening endpoint (`/v1/shortenurl`) is now working correctly
- All gRPC services (RegisterUser, LoginService, and Shorten) are properly accessible through the HTTP gateway

## Testing
The URL shortening endpoint can now be tested with:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "https://www.example.com/very/long/url", "username": "Bson"}' \
     http://localhost:8080/v1/shorten
```

## Additional Notes
- The gateway is properly configured to handle all four services:
  - RegisterUser service - /v1/registeruser
  - LoginService - /v1/login
  - Shorten service - /v1/shortenurl
  - ExtendUrl Service - /v1/extendurl
- Each service is registered with the same gRPC server endpoint (`localhost:7777`)
- The gateway uses insecure credentials for local development
